#### **DEPRECATED:** `hazelcast-kubernetes` plugin has been merged with [`hazelcast`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast)!
Since version `5.0` `hazelcast` includes `hazelcast-kubernetes` and does not require additional dependency. For details about running Hazelcast on Kubernetes consider the [documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/kubernetes/deploying-in-kubernetes).
